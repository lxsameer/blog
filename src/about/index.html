            My name is Sameer and I'm a senior developer and project manager at Yellowen and
            a proud member of GNU Project and Karajlug Community. I love programming and I spend
            most of my time developing Free softwares. I don't like to write a lot of articles or
            be involved to much into the philosophy of things, Instead I like to do practical things
            and I let my work speak for itself.
