It's been about a year since we started working on the second major version of
[Faalis](http://faalis.io) and finally we released v2 yesterday. This release introduce
a complete set of new features something near a rewrite.

## What changed
Maybe the most important change introduced in v2.x in compare to 0.x, and 1.x is the
**new dashboard**. Previous dashboard system was a javascript application based on
AngularJS library. At first when we developed the old dashboard, world still did not
find out about the dark side of AngularJS and every one was so happy with it, but after
a while every one including us begin to realise that AngularJS 1.x has some very serious
issues. For example "angular world" was a huge pain in the ass. Long story short we decided
to not to continue with AngularJS. Our most important reasons were:

* Handling two different application code base takes too much energy.
* Our assets got too big.
* We ended up with a giant JS application which was too slow.
* The damn "Angular World" which caused us lots of work and pain.
* JS application got complex and after a while debugging it was so hard
* And finally [Turbolinks](https://github.com/rails/turbolinks) rocks.

The above reasons were enough to drive me crazy. In that time I suddenly remembered something
important by watching [@dhh](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/) keynote
[talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJVTM7mE1Cc) on RailsConf 2015. I was totally forgot about
how awesome [Turbolinks](https://github.com/rails/turbolinks) can be. In the past I was ignorant about
**Turbolinks** simply because it was'nt that good at the time being.
