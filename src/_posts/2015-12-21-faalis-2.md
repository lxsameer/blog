It's been about a year since we started working on the second major version of
[Faalis](http://faalis.io) and finally we released v2 yesterday. This release introduce
a complete set of new features something near a rewrite.

## What changed
Maybe the most important change introduced in v2.x in compare to 0.x, and 1.x is the
**new dashboard**. Previous dashboard system was a javascript application based on
AngularJS library. At first when we developed the old dashboard, world still did not
find out about the dark side of AngularJS and every one was so happy with it, but after
a while every one including us begin to realise that AngularJS 1.x has some very serious
issues.
