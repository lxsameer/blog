If you're a `Django` developer you probably know about its wonderful [sites framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/contrib/sites/).

>Django comes with an optional “sites” framework. It’s a hook for associating objects and functionality to particular Web sites, and it’s a holding place for the domain names and “verbose” names of your Django-powered sites.

>Use it if your single Django installation powers more than one site and you need to differentiate between those sites in some way.

Using Sites framework of **Djangoo** your can serve different websites with different contents via a single installtion
of Django framework.

As an Ex-pythonist I really loved this feature.
