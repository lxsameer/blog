description: I found out the truth about my diet
---

Years ago I was a professional basketball player, playing the point guard. Some day
my foot broke in a match and I stayed at home for about 6 month. I those days I thought
eating more food equal to recovering faster from injury ( Yeah I know I was yound ).
Before the injury I was about 73Kg, and after the injury I turned 117Kg ( Wow I knooww).

Long story short afterward I tried really hard to loss weight, but as may most of you
experienced before humans loss weight in diet priods but the lost weight will find its way
back when diet finished.

After 3 years of that insident I started **Kyokushin Karate**, one of the most brutal, heavy and
tough sport possible. Also I was in a diet most of time. I lost weight a lot but as soon as I end
the dient I gain weight again. I always was curious why is that ? I try really hard but as soon as
I ending the diet I gain weight again.

Week ago I found out the truth behind this problem. **Liver** is the most important body part responsible
for storing extra energy of food as fat, and burning fat and produce energy when body needs it.

In this era most when most of us eats fast foods, breath posine instead of air and lots of other reasons,
Most of humans are suffering from a fatty liver in different levels. A fatty liver can't do its job perfectly,
So it can't burn fat correctly, And that's because after a diet people gains weight again. No matter how
hard they try.

Ok now what's can we do ?
