[Reactnative](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) is an other try to bring modern web
into mobile application development world. It follows a much brilliant way than previous tries
like [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) or other similar software. **ReactNative** applications
run a javascript engine on thread and execute the application js code on that thread and render
the result in main thread. This simple idea ( it's much complicated than this, but for the sake of
simplicity I won't get to it ) allows us to use native platform components via javascript interact with
them much easier.


**ReactNative** is much easier to use alternative to native application development. Let's face it
**Java** and **Objective-C** and even **Swift** are not as easy to use as **Javascript**. Personally
I don't like **Javascipt** either but it's the easier choice.
